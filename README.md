# Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a company's sales dataset. The analysis focuses on extracting valuable insights related to customer demographics, popular products, and geographical sales patterns. The dataset used in this project provides information about customer's gender, age group, occupation, and the products they purchased.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository under the `dataset` directory. The main file is `Sales data.csv`, which contains the raw sales data.

## Requirements

To run the analysis, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git
cd sales-data-analysis
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Sale%Analysis.ipynb
```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the analysis step by step.
